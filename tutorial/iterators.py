# Iterator
# An object representing a stream of data

"""

 Repeated calls to the iteratorâ€™s __next__() method
 (or passing it to the built-in function next()) return successive items in the stream
 
 Iterators are required to have an __iter__() method
 that returns the iterator object itself

 When there are no more elements, __next__() raises a StopIteration exception
 which tells the for loop to terminate
